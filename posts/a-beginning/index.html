<p>These few lines represent the beginning of an expression conveyed through the written word. Or perhaps the typed word.<br>
I have been actively using the internet for more than 20 years now and first envisioned putting thoughts of mine in a public space at least 15 years ago.<br>
That intent never transitioned from potential into actual, until now.<br>
Hopefully now my thoughts and humble investigations into reality will prove of use to others and, let&rsquo;s hope, to myself as well.<br>
Hence reactiveness might transform into proactiveness, for once.</p>
<p>Delving into systems and extracting meaningful information out of them is an integral part of what, and who, I am.<br>
My interest lies, often enough, in the abandoned, the obsolete, as well as in the misunderstood, the cryptic and the laid-aside.<br>
And the exploration of its significance.<br>
Part of it being the insights it provides in the quintessence of the whole.<br>
By profession, and choice, I deal in the intricacies of digital systems and information and as such much of the contents here will revolve around that large segment of our contemporary reality.</p>
